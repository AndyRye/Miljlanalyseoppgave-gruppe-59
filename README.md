# Project

This project must be carried out in groups of three. If, for any reason, someone is unable to work in a group, they must apply to work individually.
The project is divided into the following parts:

1. General Part: Background information about the project and tasks that are common to all parts.
2. Portfolio Part 1: Focuses on data collection and preparation.
3. Portfolio Part 2: Focuses on data analysis and visualization.
